# Bible Reminder 365
This app exists to help anyone interested in reading the Bible daily to stay on track, by emailing you the full text of your Bible reading plan for that day--every day.

Sign up at [biblereminder365.com](https://biblereminder365.com).

Currently, users can receive between 1 and 12 chapters of the Bible each day from the following translations:
- ESV
- NET
- KJV
- KVJ Easy Read
- ASV
- WEB
- Basic English Bible
- Douay Rheims
- Young's Literal Translation
- Darby
- Webster's Bible

Emails are pre-formatted for readability and can be delivered at whatever time of day the user chooses. Text messages can also be sent, with a link to read the Bible in the web app.

If you have any questions or suggestions, I look forward to [hearing from you](mailto:bstewardcodes@gmail.com)!

_Tolle Lege!_
